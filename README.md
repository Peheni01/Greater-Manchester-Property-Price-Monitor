- **Data Transformation** - Converted categorical variables and grouped price ranges for better visualization.  
- **Missing Data Handling** - Addressed missing locality information and ensured proper indexing in SQL tables.  

## Data Analysis & Dashboard Design  
- **Line Chart** shows **monthly sales trends** from 2019-2022, revealing seasonal variations in the market.
